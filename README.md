# FlexForms

FlexForms is a form extension built by developers, for developers. It's:

* build for Joomla 3.x
* based on F0F (you need to install it, it's not the included FOF within the Joomla! Core)
* uses JForm XML files for the form building and validation
* has a per-form layout override system to allow individual styles
* triggers the Joomla plugin system to allow special tasks when submitting a form
